    <h2>
      what is a <span class="tiny">tiny</span><span class="open">open</span><span class="jam">jam</span>?
    </h2>
    <p>
      It's a plan of attack for accomplishing a project. The goal of a Tiny Open
      Jam is to make a sizeable amount of progress without feeling too
      overwhelmed to start it.
    </p>

    <h3 class="tiny">Tiny</h3>
    <p>
      Think of the smallest amount of value you'd be satisfied adding to your
      project before proudly showing it off to someone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Go from Complete to Complete -- don't leave your project in an unusable
      state or less "finished" than when you started!
    </p>

    <h3 class="open">Open</h3>
    <p>
      Complete your work with the expectation that others will view it
      upon completion.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the extreme, this could mean the work you do is open-source (e.g.
      code). In fact, this is encouraged.
    </p>

    <h3 class="jam">Jam</h3>
    <p>
      The work can be completed in the uninterrupted period of time you set
      aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other definitions: improvising in order to accomplish your work, can be
      completed with friends, can involve rocking out to music.
    </p>

    <h2>
      How can I start my own <span class="tiny">tiny</span><span class="open">open</span><span class="jam">jam</span>?
    </h2>

    <p>
      It's pretty simple. All you need is <strong>a goal</strong> and <strong>a
        deadline</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Make sure your goal is <span class="tiny">tiny</span>. If it seems too
      daunting to accomplish, make it <em class="tiny">tinier</em>. But also
      make it significant enough so that when you complete it, the first thing
      you want to do is tweet about it, insta-share it, and tell all your friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      For your deadline, make sure it's soon enough that you can <span
        class="jam">jam</span> without being interrupted. You can always take
      breaks (and we encourage it), but during this time you should primarily be
      focused on getting your work done.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rest of <span class="tiny">Tiny</span><span class="open">Open</span><span class="jam">Jam</span>
      is just an attitude thing. Keep the three principles in mind while you work
      and you'll be good to go!

        target="_blank">tinyopenvideos</a> as a jumping-off point and <span class="open">open</span>
      guide for those who don't know how to get started. each video can be considered
      its own <span class="jam">jam</span> and should be <span class="tiny">tiny</span>
      enough to complete.
